# RSS-Feed-Finder---Spiceworks

##### WHAT IT DOES:

This was a script to find many of Spiceworks.com RSS feeds.  

#####STORY BEHIND IT:

So, I'm pretty big in to having a list of RSS feeds that I scroll through.  I just like being able have all my news sources in to one locations and just get in, get thru, get done with it.  On the lines of quick and dirty, I thought, hmm... could I easily incorporate Spiceworks into my other news.  So I went off on a hunt for Spiceworks RSS Feeds.  But low and be hold, there's no documentation or anything else that easily lists what feeds there are and how to get them.  I searched the forums a bit and found some old posts about the topic, but nothing was very current nor were there any listings.  I did learn some things though and decided, "you know what... I bet I can find a good portion of them"With that said, I went don't the coding rabbit hole and slapped together ( *a little messily* ) a 'scanning tool'

#####HOW TO USE:

This is an AUTOHOTKEY script.  Just save it to device and execute it like any other scipt.

#####NOTES:

The script is a bit slow.  No parallel process here.  I was looking for something relatively quickly (*even though I did put some foo-foo into it*) put together and didn't want to take time managing CPU and RAM utilization.  Also, it wasn't like this was a time-sensitive project either.  Took only a few minutes to whip up the code.  A few more to make it pretty and some bug squishing.  I know it's not well commented, but it was for me and probably only a one time use.  Just thought maybe others would like to have it too.
